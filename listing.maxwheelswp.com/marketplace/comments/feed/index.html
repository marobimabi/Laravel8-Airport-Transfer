					<description><![CDATA[Great buy, especially for the money. The speaker placement in our Caravan is not well thought out. It&#039;s too quiet for the kids in the middle and too loud for the kids in the far back. After our road trip I bought these and installed them in the back of the front two seats. It is a little too much bass (vibrates the seat and bothers my wife) but that was my fault for wanting better sound.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This works very well on my BMW 328I which has a curb weight of around 3800 lbs. The BMW is really low to the ground and this just barely fits under carriage. If you have a car that is super low to the ground, I suggest taking the front wheels off the trolley.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was hoping this mirror would match the one I needed to replace; meaning it has the two prongs for wires at the top and the base for electrical hook up slightly lower. It has the prongs but not the other electrical component. I won&#039;t know until winter if it works as a heated mirror. Also, the glass is wavy which makes it a little difficult to focus.]]></description>
